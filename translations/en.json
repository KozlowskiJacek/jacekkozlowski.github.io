I'm still passionate about the automotive world, but only when it comes to my own projects, without client pressure. Instead, I discovered that I'm passionate about creating – both in code and media. I love building applications, automating processes, and crafting engaging content. I initially studied computer science full-time, but I soon realized that I prefer learning practical skills that I can immediately apply – so I switched to part-time studies and began intensively developing my skills as a programmer and content creator.",
